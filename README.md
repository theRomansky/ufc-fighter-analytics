# UFC Fighter Analytics

Welcome to the UFC Fighter Analytics project repository! This project is dedicated to the analysis of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fighters' data, exploring various aspects of their statistics, styles, and trends.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the [following Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaronfriasr/ufc-fighters-statistics):

Please refer to the dataset link for more information about its contents and usage terms.

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze UFC fighter data, focusing on various statistical metrics such as wins, losses, draws, striking accuracy, takedown accuracy, and more. The main objective is to gain insights into fighter performance and characteristics that contribute to success in the UFC.

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The initial phase of the project involved data cleaning and preprocessing. This included handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming features for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA phase, I explored different aspects of the data, visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends among various fighter statistics. This helped in understanding the underlying patterns and relationships within the dataset.

### Feature Engineering
To enhance the analysis, I created new features such as win percentage, which provides a comprehensive measure of fighter performance. Additionally, I categorized fighters based on weight classes to investigate performance differences across different weight divisions.

### Modeling and Prediction
Using the processed data, I built a linear regression model to predict fighter win percentages. The model was trained on relevant features and evaluated using mean squared error (MSE). The achieved MSE suggests a reasonable level of prediction accuracy.
